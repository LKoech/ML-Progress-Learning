This is my journey in learning ML following different tuitorials and rescources.

# Hot Dog or Not Hotdog

This is project is a simplified way of understanding convolutional neural networks. 

We simply identify wether an image presented to the model is a Hotdog or not.

This is type of ML is Supervised learning where we use labeled inputs and a corresponding output label 

this is to help the model to learn and improve gradually.
